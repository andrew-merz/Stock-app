Welcome to Stock Screener!

Stock Screener is a React-based front-end application used to view real-time information about stocks and the stock market. Using the Yahoo Finance API, users can view the market as a whole on the home page or they can search for detailed information by typing in a specific stocks ticker in the search bar.
